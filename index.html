      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        The Oneness is an installation sound piece that is inspired by the transience and change that our world is currently experiencing. While every individual’s situation is unique, the common human feelings produced by these global transitions bind people together across boundaries of physical space. The Oneness experience comprises a sound composition that is played in a special environment. Its goal is to promote similar mental and physical reactions in people regardless of how disparate their mental states are upon entering the Oneness. It is intended to bring the participants to the present and make them focus on their body/physical senses; bringing them first more viscerally into themselves and then into the surrounding world once the piece ends.
        <br>
        The sound composition is an eight minute long combination of overlapping and interwoven layers of various sine frequencies, which change in intensity and tone throughout the piece. Other sounds are played and layered onto the sine waves during the piece to help shift the mood of the experience. The loud, repetitive sounds are meant to be mesmerising, carrying the participant on a journey to relaxation.
        <br>
        The Oneness itself is installed in the back of a hatchback car, using easily obtainable household materials so that any person can recreate the physical experience in a vehicle of their own. The seats in the back of the car are laid flat to be flush with the trunk floor, creating a large flat space, which is covered with blankets. The car is blacked out using blankets tucked into the windows, handles, and other parts of the car. The only source of light comes from colored water sitting on the sunroof of the car.
        <br>
        The sound composition is played over the car speakers, so the resulting vibrations resonate through the car, shaking the floor, walls, and roof. The participants, lying on the blankets, feel the sound all along their bodies. As the participants shift and touch different parts of the car, their experience alters as the vibrations coming through different structures/materials sound and feel different. Since the roof of the car is vibrating, the water on the sunroof moves along with the frequencies, casting the moving light around the cabin.
        <br>
        The participants are completely enveloped in the sound: feeling, hearing, and seeing the frequencies, hopefully bringing oneness with both themselves and our shared surroundings.

      <h1>Installation</h1>
      <img src="media/DSC06416.JPG">
      <p>The installation was set up in this Honda Fit. The front seats were pushed all the way up towards the front of the car with the backs leaned forward as much as possible. A blanket was held in place by both front windows and tucked into the sun visors. This blanket eliminated light from the windshield and hid the dashboard, steering wheel, and automotive controls. 
      </p>
      <img src="media/DSC06424.JPG">
      <img src="media/DSC06423.JPG">
      <p>More blankets were held by the rear passenger windows and the trunk/hatchback door. The small blind spot side windows were covered with cardboard that was cut to shape and secured with tape. A blanket covered the flat cargo area for comfort, and another blanket (checkered blanket in picture) was bunched up at the front as a head rest.
      </p>
      <img src="media/DSC06434.JPG">
      <img src="media/DSC06417 (2).JPG">
      <p>The sunroof was covered with cardboard that has a circular cutout in the middle, just big enough for a purple plastic IKEA bowl. In the bowl was purple liquid, dyed with food coloring, letting less light into the cabin and making the light that does enter more purple. The liquid was retained inside the container by plastic wrap taped across the top. The bowl itself was taped inside the cardboard hole. The entire apparatus was secured to the top of the car with tape.
        <br>
        An important note is to not leave tape on your car for long, or if the conditions aren’t windy you may not need tape at all. 
      </p>

      <img src="media/IMG_20200426_170034 (2).jpg">
      <img src="media/DSC06422.JPG">
      <p>The bottom of the sunroof was then completely dark except for the purple spot. The car wasn't level, which had an unintended, but welcome, side effect of the water pooling more in the downhill side causing a color gradient across the bowl. This cast purple and pink light onto the blankets inside, as seen above.
      </p>
      <img src="media/back.jpg">
      <p>This view shows the back of the car, if the participant were to look down towards their legs.
      </p>
      <img src="media/IMG_20200425_183758.jpg">
      <p>When lying down, the participants put their head underneath the sunroof. The car can comfortably fit two people
        in this layout.

        <p>“The low frequency took me out of my thoughts and made me not think about where I was. Then the high
          frequencies
          came in and my thoughts would reset.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“The visuals changed throughout the piece as my eyes adjusted to the surroundings, spending more time in the
          car made me have a deeper experience.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>“I became more and more tense as the tempo increased, then when it became constant there was a sense of
          relief.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <!--<p class="name align-self-end">-Lucky Jordan</p>-->
        <p> “The sounds, specifically the rumbling, made the car alive.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> “I felt completely at the mercy of the experience, completely floating along with it.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> “I went in and out of thinking about my day or whatever, but would continually be brought back into my body
          and the sound throughout the piece.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> “Over time my body became in sync with whatever was happening and I started to get relaxed and lulled by the
          sound.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> “My sense of time was altered and I got lost in the sound. When the door opened at the end I suddenly
          remembered
          where I was and was brought back to the present.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> “[This experience] really made me focus on my body a lot and then I took in the world around me much more
          than
          before after stepping out.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> “This made me go into my internal thoughts/internal self. I feel more retrospective now. It made me wonder
          how different or similar the experience is for other people.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> “...It seems like what a space pod would be.”

    <div class="section" id="diy">
      <h1>DIY</h1>
      <br>
      <p>If you want to experience this installation for yourself, it is easy to put together in any car. Find all the
        blankets you
        can get your hands on in your house and work on tucking and clamping them over/in all the windows.
        <br>
        If you have a hatchback you can put the seats down so multiple people can lie down. If not, the back seats can
        fit one
        person lying down at a time.
        <br>
        You can download the audio (section below). Play the audio over your car speakers, turning the volume up as much
        as you
        are comfrotable with (louder is better). If you have bass controlls in your car, try playing with the settings
        to get the
        most vibrations in the car.
        <br>
        If you have a sunroof, you can find a colored container or put some food coloring in water in a clear container.
        Try to cover the rest of the sunroof as best you can; cardboard works well but rags or folded blankets would
        also work
        well. If you don’t have a sun roof, just try to black the car out as much as possible.
        <br>
        If you don’t have a car or don’t want to set up the full installation, you can still download the sound
        piece and listen on headphones or good speakers. The better the speakers/headphones, the more you will “feel”
        the piece.
        The car will shake you, but with a good sound system, you could get a similar experience.

          Harmonicity, The
          Tonal Walkway” by Julianne Swartz 2016</a></h2>
      <p>This exhibition, which is currently on display at MASS MoCA, has speakers integrated into a walking bridge.
        The speakers play 24 specific tones recorded by different people. These specific tones with associated vocal
        qualities
        are supposed to evoke specific emotions. So as you walk down this pathway you are exposed to the different tones
        and
        “mental effects” as you travel through. From this piece, I want to learn how to seamlessly integrate speakers
        and sound
        into a space. I also want to do research into the tonal qualities that she based her piece from and see if I can
        use
        them as inspiration for how I can manipulate sound.

      </h2>
      <p>Dream House is an entire apartment in New York City that has been transformed into an otherworldly space of
        sound
        and light. As you move through the house you experience new mediums of art as the sound and light melds
        together. I
        want to visit and experience this piece so that I can gain inspiration for how to implement art as a living
        thing; to
        completely envelop people and transport them to a new mental space.

      <h2><a href="https://massmoca.org/event/james-turrell/">“Perfectly Clear” by James Turrell
          1991</a></h2>
      <p>This work is one of his “Ganzfeld” pieces that makes the viewer lose all depth perception, completely removing
        them from the physical space they are in. I want to learn more about James Turrell and visit more of his pieces
        to gain
        inspiration on how you can transform a space with lighting.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="http://jamesturrell.com/work/cross-cut/">“Cross Cut” by James Turrell 1998</a></h2>
      <p>Another of Turrell’s, this piece is one of his “wedgeworks” where he lights a space to look like it has walls
        and barriers where there are none. What I love about his installations are that they make you stop and think;
        you get
        completely absorbed by the work. It takes time to appreciate his pieces and you’re rewarded when you do so as
        you
        uncover more the longer you look. I’d love to have some of the same elements in my installation.
      </p>
      <h2><a href="http://www.spencerfinch.com/view/installations/38">“Candlelight” by Spencer Finch</a>
      </h2>
      <p>This installation by Finch recreates the exact light cast by a candle inside a room by color shifting the
        outside
        sunlight. I am inspired by his ability to transform the feeling of a space in such a simple way. I’d love to
        alter the
        natural light in some way in my final piece.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="updates">
      <h1>Updates</h1>
      <img src="media/origional design.png">
      <p>The original plan was to have the installation take up a full room and be semi-permanent art exhibit; taking
        some
        effort to install and take down. There was still going to be color shifted light, and the entire room would have
        been
        padded with white carpet. There would have been a temporary floor built in the room with subwoofers attached to
        the
        bottom side of the platform, causing the participant to feel the vibrations of the sound waves from the floor.
        There
        would have been speakers hung from the ceiling playing the non-sine-wave sounds, creating a more directional
        piece.
        <br>
        When we had to leave campus, I lost access to a room to permanently set up the exhibit and the access to the
        expensive
        speakers I needed to successfully execute the project.
      </p>
      <img src="media/final design.png">
      <p>However, I realized that my car has good surround sound speakers that shake the car when bass plays. So the
        current
        iteration of the installation formed.
        <br>
        The largest change is the permanence and access to the installation. In the original, it would have been
        accessible
        most times of the day; looping the sound piece. However, my car is a necessary resource for grocery shopping, so
        I
        couldn’t leave the blankets up for a week. I also couldn’t run my car all day for a week without running out of
        gas
        or burning through the battery. So, the experience became much more transient. People experienced it not on
        their own
        terms, but when I had the availability to set it up and they couldn’t stay in there for as long as they desired.
        However, this abrupt start and end to their exposure with the installation added an element of shock which, I
        now
        believe heightened the effects of the piece. There was no time to mentally prepare or investigate, so the
        conversations
        and thoughtfulness after was more necessary to unpack the experience.
